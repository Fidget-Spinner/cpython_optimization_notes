# CPython Optimization Notes

## Introduction
CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language
(https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html). In this document, Iâ€™ll summarise
major speedups to the core parts of CPython which will make 3.11
(coming in 2022) measurably faster than 3.10. I only plan to cover optimizations
that shift  macrobenchmarks such as pyperformance. There are too many
optimizations done by brilliant people in other parts of CPython for me to list.

To get the most out of this, you should have knowledge of Python (especially in
data model/dunder methods). Being able to read C is also a plus though not
strictly necessary. Some knowledge of common data structures (hash tables,
linkedlist, etc.) is also beneficial.

If youâ€™re interested in the internals of CPython, and/or want to contribute, I
believe this document has some educational value for you. If you find any parts
hard to understand due to poor wording or plain inaccuracies, please open a PR!

Dive in by reading the [index for 3.11](./3.11/README.md).
